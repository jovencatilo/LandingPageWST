    <p class="statement">
        Volleyball has been a lifelong passion for me, stemming from my elementary school days. 
        As a Middle Blocker on my team, the court is where I truly come alive. 
        It becomes a canvas for my competitiveness and discipline, qualities that seamlessly translate into my daily life.

        Participating in various leagues both within and beyond the barangay has been a significant part of my journey. 
        A defining moment occurred in June 2023 when I earned the honor of being recognized as part of the "Mythical Six."
        This achievement marked a pivotal and redeeming moment in my volleyball journey, affirming my value and capabilities as a dedicated player.

        Now, I find fulfillment in encouraging the younger generation to pursue this field. 
        I believe that engaging in volleyball not only allows them to grow as individuals but also 
        empowers them to inspire others. It's a sport that extends beyond the court, fostering personal 
        development and a spirit of inspiration that can positively impact the lives of those around them.

        <h1>Volunteering</h1>
        </div>
        <p class="statement">
            During my free time, I dedicate myself to volunteering for both non-governmental and 
            governmental organizations, contributing to initiatives that support vulnerable communities 
            within my barangay. Given that my father holds the position of Barangay Chairman, 
            I actively engage in projects that aim to foster active citizenship and benefit the youth in our community.

        </div>
        <p class="statement">
            Inspired by my father's values, I am driven by the idea of personally contributing to the well-being of 
            marginalized and underrepresented communities. Given the chance to establish a non-profit organization, 
            I would create EdukForYouth,
             aiming to support students in need and empower them to pursue their aspirations through education.

                Traveling serves as my remedy for stress; it's my escape to find peace. 
                Exploring different places brings me joy, as I revel in the beauty of things uncommon to my eyes. 
                I eagerly anticipate embarking on journeys to various destinations, eager to discover new 
                landscapes and experiences.

                Given the opportunity to travel internationally, my dream destination would undoubtedly be New York City, USA. Additionally, I have a strong desire to explore Tokyo, Bangkok, 
                the United Arab Emirates, various states in the United States, Australia, Canada, Spain, and England.
